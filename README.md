## Human Activity Recognition (HAR): Speed Estimation using Channel State Infromation(CSI) in WiFi

*Experiments:*  
Collected time-series data in a wifi-enabled environment for angle 30, 60 and 85 degree. 

*Preprocessing (data analysis)*    
Denoising the collected raw data using Discrete Wavelet Transform.   
Features reduction using Principle Components Analysis.  
Calculated statistical properties for each sample. 

*Classification model*    
Classify the angle using the linear support vector machine (SVM).
