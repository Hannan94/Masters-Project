# Masters-Project
Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using WiFi signal Channel State Information (CSI). 

Experiments:
Collect time-series data in a wifi-enabled environment for walking, running,
sitting, and fall human activities. 

Preprocessing (data analysis)    
Denoising the collected raw data using Discrete Wavelet Transform. Features reduction using Principle Components Analysis. Calculated statistical properties for each sample

Classification model
Classify Human activities using the linear support vector machine (SVM)
